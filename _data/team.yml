  bio: Rahul started StatRookie as a way for fans to tap into their love of sports to help them 
       in the classroom. As an engineer in the aerospace industry, he understood the importance 
       of breaking down complex topics into simple, relatable concepts. As a sports fan, he took 
       this same idea and applied it to the core of StatRookie. Rahul's goal is to ensure that all 
       fans have the confidence and the resources to quantify their observations on and off the court.

  bio: Driven by a passion for sports, basketball in particular, Richard Lu has spent years meticulously 
       researching the NBA to hone his analytical skills. This strong background in breaking down data 
       allowed him to serve as an analytic consultant for the Phoenix Suns and Chicago Bulls in the early 
       2010s. His most notable achievement in this time is that he utilized a proprietary draft methodology 
       to identify Jimmy Butler in the 2011 NBA Draft as an undervalued prospect that could flourish in the 
       right conditions. This assessment has proven to be true because in the time since that draft, Butler 
       has gone on to earn All-NBA and All-Defensive team honors multiple times in his career. With great 
       dedication and attention to detail, Richard draws upon this past experience to provide the same high-level 
       of quality to the analytics used in this platform. Also, he annually publishes independent, research-based 
       books to preview upcoming NBA seasons and evaluate incoming draft prospects on 
       <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Richard-Lu/e/B07DNRZ31M">Amazon</a>. Finally, he graduated 
       with a bachelor’s degree from the University of Southern California and is originally from St. Louis, 
       Missouri, which makes him an avid Cardinals and Blues fan.
