                <b>Expose your fans to math and data literacy through sports</b> <br>
                Wide-scale access to resources for math and data literacy is not readily available to all students.
                Exposure to math and data literacy in education often is accomplished through a combination of project
                learning, mentors, STEM camps, an afterschool club, or home life. The adoption of math and data into
                sports, through analytics, provides a unique opportunity to create an accessible exposure to STEM
                through sports. StatRookie uses this method to develop authentic educational experiences for the fans of
                teams and players.
