            <h2>Our Product</h2>
            <p>
                StatRookie is a fan engagement platform that focuses on educational outreach.
                We are currently developing content for Basketball, Soccer, and Baseball through
                the following process:
            </p>

            <!-- <h4>Our Process</h4> -->
            <p>
            <ol class="ml-5">
                <li>
                    <b>Start with sports and relate it to math. KEEP IT AUTHENTIC!</b><br>
                    Our sports analytics experts develop questions based on sporting scenarios, which require math and
                    data to solve. Each question starts what we call a module, for example, <i>What is the chance a
                        pitcher’s next pitch results in a ground ball to double play?</i> All of our modules use real
                    data from
                    players, teams, and games to keep it authentic.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Use a problem-based approach to learning to present the concept.</b><br>
                    Our UX team translates the sporting scenario for each module into a simple but engaging learning
                    experience where the user can explore the concept without feeling like they are doing math.

                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Present the questions in multiple ways for all types of learners.</b><br>
                    Our UX team designs our modules to communicate concepts visually, verbally, and analytically to
                    accommodate all types of learners.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Concepts scale in breadth and complexity.</b><br>
                    Our content continually grows the user’s knowledge of each concept. We design modules to allow
                    exploration on the same plane of complexity and to scale in complexity as the user becomes
                    comfortable with the presented concept. This allows the introduction of new material as well as
                    making the learning experience engaging.
                </li>
                <!-- <li>
                    <b>Validate content from a student and fan perspective.</b><br>
                    We review our content with experts in education and with users to ensure it meets educational standards,
                    is effective for learning, and is fun!
