            <h4>What do we do?</h4>
            <p>
                StatRookie is a competitive fan engagement platform that focuses on education. We use sports analytics
                as a medium to teach math and data literacy skills. Our content is designed for any fan to gain the
                confidence to quantify their observations in and out of the sports arena.
            </p>

            <h4>Why StatRookie?</h4>

            <p>
                At StatRookie, we focus on creating great content that fans can use.
                Our approach specifically focuses on three values that we have as sports fans.  
                First, we use real player data and real-life situations to make our content <b>authentic</b>.
                Second, we make our content <b>actionable</b> so fans can take what they learn from StatRookie 
                and apply it to their sports interests. And third, we work to present StatRookie content in an
                <b>engaging</b> way so that fans continue to challenge themselves to keep learning. 
            </p>

            <h4>Status</h4>
                <p>
                    We are currently developing StatRookie for basketball, soccer, and baseball and looking
                    for launch partners. Please contact us if you are a team, league, or other representative
                    and we will set up a time to demo our product.
