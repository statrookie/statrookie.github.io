            <h2>About StatRookie</h2>

            <p>Our mission at StatRookie is to give sports fans the ability to use their passion for sports to power an eagerness for learning.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>What do we do?</h4>
            <p>
                StatRookie is a competitive fan engagement platform that focuses on education. We use sports analytics
                as a medium to teach math and data literacy skills. Our content is designed for any fan to gain the
                confidence to quantify their observations in and out of the sports arena.
            </p>

            <h4>Why StatRookie?</h4>

            <p>
                At StatRookie, we focus on creating great content that fans can use.
                Our approach specifically focuses on three values that we have as sports fans.
                First, we use real player data and real-life situations to make our content <b>authentic</b>.
                Second, we make our content <b>actionable</b> so fans can take what they learn from StatRookie
                and apply it to their sports interests. And third, we work to present StatRookie content in an
                <b>engaging</b> way so that fans continue to challenge themselves to keep learning.
            </p>

                We are currently developing StatRookie for basketball, soccer, and baseball and looking
                for launch partners. Please contact us if you are a team, league, or other representative
                and we will set up a time to demo our product.

            <h2>Our Founding Story</h2>
            <p>Our journey started at the 2019 Sloan Analytics Startup Competition, developing a product that helped
                fans understand sports analytics. As we continued to build our product, we discovered that sports
                analytics are the perfect medium for teaching math and data literacy skills to fans. We have taken this
                discovery and integrated it into making an impactful product. As our product has evolved, the StatRookie
                team has grown to include talented designers and analysts, who share the vision of using sports to
                explore education. </p>
