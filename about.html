            <h1>Our Founding Story</h1>

            <p>
                Our journey started at the 2019 Sloan Analytics Startup Competition, developing 
                a product that helped fans understand sports analytics. As we continued to build 
                our product, we discovered that sports analytics are the perfect medium for 
                teaching math and data literacy skills to fans. We have taken this discovery and
                integrated it into making an impactful product. As our product has evolved, the 
                <a href="/team">StatRookie team</a> has grown to include talented designers and 
                analysts, who share the vision of using sports to explore education.
            </p>


            <h1>What is StatRookie?</h1>
            <p>
                StatRookie is a fan engagement platform that focuses on educational outreach. Fans engage with real
                player and team data to answer questions about sports analytics and strategy through bite-size learning
                modules.
            </p>

            <h1>Our Values</h1>

            <p>
                Our content is created with three values in mind.
                First, we use real player data and real-life situations to make our content <b>authentic</b>.
                Second, we make our content <b>actionable</b> so fans can take what they learn from StatRookie
                and apply it to their sports interests. And third, we work to present StatRookie content in an
                <b>engaging</b> way so that fans continue to challenge themselves to keep learning.
            </p>

                We are currently developing StatRookie for basketball, soccer, and baseball and looking

                and we will set up a time to demo our product.
